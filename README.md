## About the book

What principles ground your organization's culture and drive its operations? And are those principles the ones best suited to solving the problems you're facing?

In _Organize for Innovation_, Red Hat President and CEO Jim Whitehurst poses these questions as he reflects on the technological, social, and economic forces impacting the ways we work. Arguing that solving contemporary business problems requires new organizational principles, models, and dynamics, Whitehurst explains how leaders everywhere can begin rethinking how they utilize data, approach failure, structure teams, and set goals—in short, how they can become more innovative.

Compiled three years after the publication of his widely read management book, _The Open Organization_ (Harvard Business Review Press), _Organize for Innovation_ collects Whitehurst's writing on organizational culture, organizational design, and organizational leadership today—all part of an ongoing conversation about the challenges we face in transformative, fast-moving, and uncertain times.
